In 1967, activists launched 200 nights of marches pushing for passage of a meaningful open housing ordinance. This panel hosted by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will include original marchers, reflecting on what they hoped to achieve and where we stand today, as well as representatives of groups working to improve housing and increase opportunities. The panel moderator will be March On Milwaukee 50th's Kantara Souffrant.

This is the first in a series of community discussions organized by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as part of its [50-Year Ache coverage](https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/50-year-ache/), which examines the problems and challenges that remain 50 years after the marches — and the hurdles to making progress today.

This event is free and open to the public — [please RSVP here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/housing-and-segregation-in-milwaukee-then-and-now-tickets-37757482647)
