So many groups in the Milwaukee area are working hard to do their part to build the Milwaukee we need, but are often doing so in isolation. This book is both a blueprint for activism and an inspiring call for "fusion coalitions" to come together to create actions that make a difference.

This book club is open to leaders and interested others seeking to build connections to amplify their actions.
