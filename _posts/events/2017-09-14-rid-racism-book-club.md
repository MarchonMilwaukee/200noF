## The Third Reconstruction

So many groups in the Milwaukee area are working hard to do their part to build the Milwaukee we need, but are often doing so in isolation. [The Third Reconstruction](http://www.beacon.org/The-Third-Reconstruction-P1139.aspx) is both a blueprint for activism and an inspiring call for "fusion coalitions" to come together to create actions that make a difference.

This book club, hosted by [Rid Racism MKE](http://www.ridracism-mke.org) at Bethesda Church (2810 West Highland Boulevard), is open to leaders and interested others seeking to build connections to amplify their actions.
