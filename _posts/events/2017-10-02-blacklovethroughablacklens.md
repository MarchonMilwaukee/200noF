FREE & open to the public!

Join the director of 72 Hours: A Brooklyn Love Story, Raafi Rivero, and a group of dynamic local commentators for an intimate conversation on the persistent stereotypes and authentic realities of "Black love" in the 21st century.  

Hosted by moderator Dasha Kelly Hamilton, this talk show style discussion will explore facets of intimate partner relationships, sexuality, gender roles and other love related topics from a Black perspective.  

Attendees can enjoy food compliments of Colectivo and participate in a love letter writing station while grooving to the love inspired sounds of DJ JDL.
