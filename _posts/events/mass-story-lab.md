What Do You Really Know About Milwaukee Secure Detention Facility (MSDF)?
About people detained there? About why it was built? About why people are detained there? About the family members and friends who visit MSDF? About what is needed to shut down MSDF and reinvest resources to build safer, stronger, and healthier communities?

Who Should Attend?
Anyone concerned about the current state of Wisconsin's penal system and who wants to participate in imagining new ways to build communities and promote more humane, restorative, and transformative approaches to justice.

Join us for this special storytelling event in Milwaukee to amplify the voices of people who have been directly impacted by MSDF. Through storytelling, dialogue, and community design we will envision a future beyond prisons.

Mass Story Lab is a participatory storytelling project that amplifies the voices of people who have been directly impacted by incarceration, leveraging the power of storytelling to inspire conversation and change in communities around the U.S.

[EXPO](https://www.facebook.com/expowisconsin/) works to end mass incarceration, eliminate all forms of structural discrimination against formerly incarcerated people, and restore formerly incarcerated people to full participation in the life of communities.

[EXPO](http://www.rocwisconsin.org/our-work/expo/) emerged in 2014 when formerly incarcerated people from around Wisconsin began to gather to discuss what it would look like to have our own statewide organization. Previously imprisoned women and men lead EXPO. Our members provide support to each other and organize to transform Wisconsinâ€™s unjust penal system. We receive support from family members of currently and formerly incarcerated people and allies who have not experienced incarceration. EXPO has active chapters in Milwaukee, Madison, Eau Claire, Green Bay, Superior, and the Fox Cities. We are developing chapters in Racine, Kenosha, Beloit, Waukesha County, and Wausau. EXPO is a project of [WISDOM](http://wisdomwisconsin.org/expo-ex-prisoners-organizing/  ), an organization that links faith communities across Wisconsin to work for justice.
