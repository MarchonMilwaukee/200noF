These 2 walking tours (also part of Doors Open Milwaukee) will highlight historic and contemporary public works of art commemorating key social justice leaders and events, as well as art that heightens our collective social and cultural consciousness. The Saturday loop will likely begin at 9th & Vliet and cover the Joshua Glover mural, the North Ave. murals, MLK statue, etc. The Sunday loop will likely begin at the Gandhi statue and head south across the Unity Bridge to the Cesar Chavez statue, etc.
