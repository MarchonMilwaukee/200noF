The [University of Wisconsin-Waukesha](http://waukesha.uwc.edu) and the [Southeast Wisconsin Festival of Books](http://www.sewibookfest.com) are pleased to host [Crossing the Line](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org//Records/Article/CS15090), the Wisconsin Historical Society’s exhibit about Milwaukee’s Open Housing Marches. 

To complement the exhibit, this panel offers the insights of a participant, writer, and scholar.

Playwright, director, and performer Sheri Williams Pannell, the author of Bronzeville, a play set in Milwaukee’s African American neighborhood in the 1950s. Margaret (Peggy) Rozga, a participant in the marches, has written a play and book of poetry, 200 Nights and One Day, about that experience. Patrick Jones, history professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln authored Selma of the North, a history of the open housing campaign.
