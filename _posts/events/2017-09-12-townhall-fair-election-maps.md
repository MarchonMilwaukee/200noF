Wisconsin’s voting maps are unfair. We need to work together to change this!

Unfair voting maps affect these neighborhood issues and more:

• Not enough good jobs
• Unsafe streets 
• Lead in the drinking water
• Our kids’ public schools get less funding than other neighborhoods

Come learn from community leaders!
