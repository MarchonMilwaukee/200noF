## The Third Reconstruction

So many groups in the Milwaukee area are working hard to do their part to build the Milwaukee we need, but are often doing so in isolation. This book is both a blueprint for activism and an inspiring call for "fusion coalitions" to come together to create actions that make a difference.

This book club is open to leaders and interested others seeking to build connections to amplify their actions.
