This film is part of the [Black Lens Program](https://mkefilm.org/black-lens-2017/) and the Milwaukee Film Festival:

It's a story whose reverberations will be felt across the political landscape for many years to come: ACORN, America's largest grass-roots community organization (teaching low- and medium-income families across the nation to advocate for themselves), shuttered by a pair of amateur journalists posing as a pimp and prostitute, igniting a media firestorm that helped spawn the Breitbart News empire. This real-life political thriller does much to explain our current divisive state, persuasively drawing a line from ACORN's bankruptcy to our polarized present and its constant cries of “fake news.”

Two more screenings of 'ACORN and the Firestorm' are taking place during the Milwaukee Film Festival, on October 1st and 12th. [Click here for more details.](https://mkefilm.org/acorn-and-the-firestorm/)
