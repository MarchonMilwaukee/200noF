[Cooperative Performance](https://www.facebook.com/cooperformke/), in collaboration with Alverno College, will be holding a Storytelling Workshop to encourage the development and cultivation of local immigrant stories. 

The stories will have the opportunity to be featured in Ellis â€” an original adaption of your immigration stories from past to present. Writers/Artists are encouraged, but not required, to perform their own work.
Immigration stories of various cultures are welcomed and encouraged.

Please join us for a morning of storytelling and community building. 
*Free parking*
