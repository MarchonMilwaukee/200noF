Hawai'i J20 is a nonpartisan assembly of activist citizens based at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. Our primary purpose is the promotion of a world of solidarity, and active resistance to the agenda and worldview of the Trump-Pence regime. We offer free forums in a range of formats to learn and analyze the conditions that we have inherited. 

This event, organized through Hawai'i J20's Free School book club and in solidarity with the March on Milwaukee 50th Anniversary commemoration, seeks to build on our cities' commonalities and shared visions. Hawai'i J20's conversation will seek to better understand critical events in our nation's history, to educate ourselves on Milwaukee's past and future, and to frame our own current situation within that of a much broader freedom movement, created by, of, and for the people.
