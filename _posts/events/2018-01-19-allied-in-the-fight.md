Allied in the Fight recounts the efforts made by American Jews and African Americans to fight for the fundamental American promise of equality before and during the Civil Rights era, and explores shared projects, organizational efforts, and, for a time, how many members of the African American and Jewish communities became allied against injustice. 

The local component of Allied in the Fight explores the Milwaukee coalition of Jewish and African American leaders who worked to convince their constituents of their shared quest for liberty and justice, as well the Milwaukee Fair Housing Movement Marches of 1967 and 1968. Allied in the Fight strives to address Black-Jewish collaboration and the complicated nature of Jewish contributions to the Civil Rights movement in America.

The exhibit will run from 1/19/18 to 3/25/18 at the [Jewish Museum of Milwaukee](http://jewishmuseummilwaukee.org).
