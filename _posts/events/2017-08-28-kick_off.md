This event will serve as the kick-off to 200 Nights of Freedom, emphasizing the historical significance and on-going relevance of the open housing marches and their progeny. The kick-off welcomes local, regional and statewide contributors in an effort to share the 200-day calendar of events with attendees. A key feature of this event will be the recognizing of accomplishments by March On Milwaukee leaders, many of whom are now community elders.
