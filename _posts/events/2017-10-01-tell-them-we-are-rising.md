This film is part of the [Black Lens Program](https://mkefilm.org/black-lens-2017/) and the Milwaukee Film Festival:

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have paved the way for over 150 years, allowing black intellectuals, revolutionaries, and artists alike a safe haven in which to pursue higher education and defy stereotypes among their peers in an unapologetically Black environment. Now the remarkable story of their role in African-American history is finally told. Multiple MFF alum Stanley Nelson returns with this captivating panorama of HBCUs from their conception to the modern day, a stirring portrait of perseverance in pursuit of knowledge.

Two more screenings of 'Tell Them We Are Rising: The Story of Black Colleges & Universities' are taking place during the Milwaukee Film Festival, on October 5th and 7th. [Click here for more details.](https://mkefilm.org/tell-them-we-are-rising-the-story-of-black-colleges-and-universities/)
