The Menomonee Valley was the physical barrier that marked the divide between Milwaukee’s black and white communities. In 1967, the first of the civil rights marches crossed the Menomonee Valley’s 16th Street Viaduct in protest of racial discrimination and housing segregation. 

Melissa Cook, [Hank Aaron State Trail Manager](http://www.hankaaronstatetrail.org), will provide a free walking tour to share the important history of Milwaukee’s civil rights marches and the murals that honor marchers along the Hank Aaron State Trail Menomonee River Loop. 

This tour will take place during the [Menomonee Valley Parters](http://www.renewthevalley.org) inaugural [Menomonee Valley Week](http://www.renewthevalley.org/documents/225-first-every-valley-week-from-sep-23-30).
