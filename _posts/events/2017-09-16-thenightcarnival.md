Witness- A Timekeeper with harmonic power to store time, sell time, eat time, and give time away: A being of No Time and Every Time. A Steward who defends the Space Between. A place to honor wishes or fears at the altar of Instruments of Creation and Instruments of Destruction. A Reflecting Pool to show you Your True Self. A Coyote woman who eats secrets.
