## Crossing the Line: The Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968 (Exhibit opening) 

The traveling display ["Crossing the Line: The Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968"](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/calendar/series/43/crossing-the-line) commemorates the 50th anniversary of Milwaukee's civil rights marches by examining the practices and prejudices that led to segregation in Milwaukee and chronicling the school desegregation and fair housing movements of the 1960s. It also asks the question, "What can you do to end segregation today?"
 
The eight panels of "Crossing the Line" tell the story of Milwaukee's civil rights marches in simple language, with reproductions of 33 historic photographs and documents. The display was created by the [Wisconsin Historical Society](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org) and is most suitable for secondary schools and the general public.
 
The exhibit is on display at the [Racine Public Library](http://www.racinelibrary.info/) (75 7th St, Racine, WI) from 9/6/17 to 9/21/17.
