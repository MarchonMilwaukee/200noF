Doors Open is a city wide open house event that invites the public to tour over 150 building throughout Milwaukee. During the event, the Wisconsin State Historical Society will display the travelling exhibit "Crossing the Line: The Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968" at Milwaukee's City Hall. The exhibit commemorates the 50th anniversary of Milwaukee's civil rights marches by examining the practices and prejudices that led to segregation in Milwaukee and chronicling the school desegregation and fair housing movements of the 1960s. Visit doorsopenmilwaukee.org for more about the event.
