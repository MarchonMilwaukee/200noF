This book discussion will be convened to discuss current housing inequity issues through Matthew Desmond’s [Evicted: Profit and Poverty in the American City](http://www.evictedbook.com). Evicted won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and features stories of tenants and landlords in the poorest areas of Milwaukee during 2008 and 2009.

This event is organized by the [Milwaukee Public Library](https://www.mpl.org) and will be co-facilitated with community volunteers.
