This is a free talk about children and race with associate professor Erin Winkler of UW-Milwaukee. She is author of the book “Learning Race, Learning Place: Shaping Racial Identities and Ideas in African-American Childhoods.”

We’ve all heard the myth that "children don’t notice race." Many adults avoid discussing race or racism with children, worrying that conversations will put negative ideas in children’s heads.

Dr. Winkler will describe why NOT talking about race is actually detrimental to children’s ability to form positive ideas and images about race, and give participants ways to discuss race issues in age-appropriate and empowering ways. This is a great opportunity for parents, grandparents, teachers, friends to listen, engage, and ask questions. Together we can help our children lead us into a healthier, more equitable future.

Parents Advocating for Cultural Equality and Educational Excellence (PACE3) invites you to this event.
