We'll be processing mail from incarcerated people, matching people up with pen-pals, providing free letter-writing supplies - including postage, collecting signatures for EXPO's campaign to close down MSDF, among other prisoner support work.

This event is led by [Black and Pink Milwaukee](https://www.facebook.com/MKEBlackandPink/), dedicated to supporting and raising awareness towards LGBTQ and other prisoners.
