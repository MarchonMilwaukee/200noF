The First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee at 1342 N. Astor St., is developing a special service for Oct. 15 devoted to overcoming white supremacy and developing the resources for overcoming racism. This is a follow up on the May 7th event at the church, responding to the call of  Black Lives of Unitarian Universalism to address the ways in which white supremacy is reinforced within our denomination.

To help in this effort we have invited Christopher D. Sims, an African American leader in Unitarian Universalism. Christopher is a love and justice ambassador and the former co-leader of Diverse Revolutionary Unitarian Universalist Multicultural Ministries (DRUUMM). He has been on tour through the Love Is Revolutionary Ministries. He participated in solidarity actions recently in Charlottesville and will be relating his experiences. Christopher will be sharing the pulpit with our senior minister the Rev. Jennifer Nordstrom.
