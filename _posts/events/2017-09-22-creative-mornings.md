This is a breakfast lecture series for the creative community. All are welcome, even if they aren't working in the creative sector. We believe everyone is creative. We'll be having Dr. Katherine Wilson from the Ziedler Center for Public Discussion as our speaker. She'll be speaking on our global theme of "Compassion."
