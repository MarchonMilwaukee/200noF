[CreativeMornings Milwaukee](https://creativemornings.com/cities/mke) is a breakfast lecture series for the creative community. All are welcome, even if they aren't working in the creative sector. We believe everyone is creative. 

For this installment of our running series, we welcome Dr. Katherine Wilson from the [Ziedler Center for Public Discussion](https://www.zeidlercenter.org) as our speaker. She'll be speaking on our global theme of "Compassion."
