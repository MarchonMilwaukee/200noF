This fun festival celebrates the cultural diversity of the Silver City neighborhood through food, the arts, and music! 

Organized by [Layton Boulevard West Neighbors](http://www.lbwn.org/), Nearly 2,000 neighbors and visitors traveled the world along West National Avenue between South 33rd and 35th street last year and sampled ethnic cuisine from countries spanning the globe while also enjoying live art performances, free live music, free activities for kids and displays from local businesses.
