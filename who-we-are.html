<p>The March On Milwaukee 50th Coordinating Committee is a group of volunteers from a variety of backgrounds and neighborhoods. This includes an intergenerational mix of artists and activists, professionals and academics, and elders who participated in the original marches. The group has been meeting regularly since early 2016 and is building from work done in 2007 for the 40th anniversary.</p>
