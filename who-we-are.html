<p>200 Nights of Freedom is being organized by March On Milwaukee 50th, a diverse group of volunteers from a broad range of communities. This includes, but is not limited to NAACP Youth Commandos and Council Members, activists, academics, educators, artists, professionals, students and more.</p>

<p>Our first meeting took place in February 2016 and we formed our Coordinating Committee in summer of 2016. Currently, the work needed to create 200 Nights of Freedom is in being done by volunteer committees, which include Communication, Community, Digital, Education, Event, Faith, Finance and Youth.</p>

  If you are interested in joining our team, weâ€™d be more than happy to have you.
