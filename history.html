        <p>Beginning on August 28, 1967, the Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council/Commandos, Father James Groppi, Alderperson Vel Phillips, and a host of activists and community members marched for over 200 consecutive nights to demand an end to housing segregation.</p>

        <p>In many ways, the marches signify the pinnacle of the Black Freedom Movement and activism in the city. In fact, this series of marches are remembered as Milwaukee’s contribution to the story of Civil Rights in America and even helped inspire federal legislation on fair housing.</p>
