        <p>Beginning on August 28, 1967, the Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council/Commandos, Father James Groppi, Alderperson Vel Phillips, and a host of activists and community members marched for over 200 consecutive nights to demand an end to housing segregation.</p>

        <p>In many ways, the marches signify the pinnacle of the Black Freedom Movement and activism in the city. In fact, this series of marches are remembered as Milwaukee’s contribution to the story of Civil Rights in America and even helped inspire federal legislation on fair housing.</p>

        <p>For the 40th anniversary, the efforts of the March On Milwaukee committee resulted in the creation of a web-based archive housed by the UW-Milwaukee library. It contains many resources to explore, including a detailed timeline of events, as well as a map of Milwaukee with key locations and routes. It also contains an extensive bibliography with suggestions for many more books, articles, and other resources.</p>
