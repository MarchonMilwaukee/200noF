  Milwaukee-born historian Erica Metcalfe has written two crucial articles detailing the contributions of the NAACP Youth Council and Commandos to Milwaukee’s Open Housing marches.
</p>
<p>
  Both published in Wisconsin Magazine of History, Metcalfe presents deeply important Milwaukee stories that are too often forgotten. It is the sincere opinion of the March On Milwaukee 50th committee that these two short articles are essential reading for all Milwaukeeans.
