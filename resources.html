  As we’ve shared history of Milwaukee’s Open Housing Marches in communities around our city, we’ve found that this story of national importance is too often absent from our local memory. So, in addition to attending events throughout 200 Nights of Freedom, educating yourself about this history is a key way to honor the 50th anniversary.

  Milwaukee-born historian Erica Metcalfe has written two crucial articles detailing the contributions of the NAACP Youth Council and Commandos to Milwaukee’s Open Housing marches.
</p>
<p>
  Both published in Wisconsin Magazine of History, Metcalfe presents deeply important Milwaukee stories that are too often forgotten. It is the sincere opinion of the March On Milwaukee 50th committee that these two short articles are essential reading for all Milwaukeeans.
