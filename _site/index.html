        <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Starting on the night of August 28, 1967, NAACP Youth Council Commandos, Father James Groppi, Alderperson Vel Phillips, and a host of activists and community members marched for more than 200 nights to demand an end to housing segregation in Milwaukee. The marches signify, in many ways, the pinnacle of black freedom movement activism in the city.</p>

<p>This 50th anniversary commemoration honors the courage, perseverance, and solidarity of those who marched for racial justice in Milwaukee, taking inspiration from their collective efforts to reignite a spirit of collectivity and change-making.</p>

<p>What and why now: “200 Nights of Freedom: Black Power, Dissent and Youth Leadership” is the central program of the March on Milwaukee 50th Anniversary Celebration. The event will feature 200 consecutive nights of free public events that reflect upon, document, and honor the original spirit of the marches: Black power, dissent, and youth leadership.</p>

<p>Aspiration: In the spirit of honoring the original marchers’ efforts to bring about the Milwaukee that they hoped to see—a fair, civil, and racially just city—“200 Nights of Freedom” asks present day community members to participate in building the Milwaukee that we want live in, one that is open, collaborative, and welcoming to all.</p>
